All About Automation Frameworks
A free session by ITeLearn.com


0. What is Test automation. Why do we require frameworks
1. Various Automation Frameworks
2. Best practices to build
3. How to choose the right framework for your project
4. Typical challenges and how to resolve them.

Manual Testing to Automation

Record vs Custom Code
1. Gives us more control on what has to be done.
2. Add logic, add conditions, add loops
3. Optimize the code and make it more faster 
4. Take the basic code to a very advanced

Efficiency | Reusability | Accuracy

Custom Code to a Framework

What is a framework?
- Structure
- Standards
- Proven 
- Robust
- Easy to implement, change or maintain over a regular code
- Customized

***Linear Framework
User Login
- LoginLink.Click
- UserNameField.EnterText."karthik"
- PswdField.EnterText."karthik"
- RememberPswd.Click
- LoginButton.Click
- Confirm Login

Send Email
- LoginLink.Click
- UserNameField.EnterText."karthik"
- PswdField.EnterText."karthik"
- RememberPswd.Click
- LoginButton.Click
- Confirm Login
- Click compose
- type msg,
- type subj
- send
- confirm send
- logout

1000, 5000, 10000.
DisAdvantages For Linear
1. Changes require lot of time ... efficiency lost.
2. With many changes, errors are prone to happen. - Accuracy is also lost

***Functional Decomposition Framework

Adv:
1. Changes require lesser effort. Efficiency
2. Reuse this over and over.
3. Accuracy improved

DisAdv:
1. The data is hardcoded. Data is inside the code ...
2. Each time we need to change the data then, we have to go and change in the code
3. QA Team - 20% automation engineers, 80% manual engineers
4. We want the non-techy/manual engineers also to use this framework

**** Data Driven Framework

Adv:
1. Repeat the same TC for varied sets of Test Data
2. Much more faster - Efficiency
3. Sharing load with the ME

DisAdva:
1. Changes to TC requires code change
2. To add new TC, we have to do a code change

**** Keywordd Driven Framework
- Divides all test steps by using reusable keyword functions
- stores externally

Adv:
1. Changes to TC requires no code change
2. To add new TC requires no code change

DisAdv:
1. Webpages change and element identification becomes an issue
2. Dynamism in the web objects

*** Page Object/Factory Framework
Element identifications are taken and put in a new location that
can reused..

Quality testing is an integral part of any manufacturing process and it is very important in software development. At a time, when testing automation has replaced the manual testing processes, there is a huge demand for professionals in testing automation. 

ITeLearn, committed to skill development in software Testing sector comes out with a free orientation session on Automation Frameworks. This session will discuss in detail with different automation frameworks, advantages, disadvantages and career opportunities.
